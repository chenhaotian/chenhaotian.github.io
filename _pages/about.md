Welcome to my page. I am a practitioner and firm believer in probabilistic models. My role as a leader of a team of applied scientists involves disciplined research to decision making, where I focus on delivering reliable and valuable results.

If you are interested in discussing business collaborations or sharing insights, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or comment on my posts. I value meaningful professional connections and am always open to new perspectives.
